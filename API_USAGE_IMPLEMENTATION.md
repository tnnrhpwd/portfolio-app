# API Usage Tracking System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
I've implemented a comprehensive API usage tracking system for your portfolio app that tracks usage of paid external APIs and provides usage limits for Simple and CSimple memberships.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend API Usage Tracking System
- **File**: `backend/utils/apiUsageTracker.js`
- **Features**:
  - Tracks usage for OpenAI API, RapidAPI Word Generator, and RapidAPI Dictionary
  - Stores usage data in user's text field using `|Usage:` token
  - Implements usage limits: Free ($0), Flex ($10), Premium ($10 but unlimited)
  - Cost calculation based on tokens/calls
  - Usage compression format: `api-date:usage:cost` (e.g., `openai-2024-08-30:150t:$0.05`)

### 2. API Cost Configuration
- **OpenAI Models**:
  - o1-mini: $0.003/1000 input tokens, $0.012/1000 output tokens
  - o1-preview: $0.015/1000 input tokens, $0.06/1000 output tokens
  - GPT-4: $0.03/1000 input tokens, $0.06/1000 output tokens
  - GPT-3.5-turbo: $0.0015/1000 input tokens, $0.002/1000 output tokens
- **RapidAPI**: $0.002 per call for both Word Generator and Dictionary

### 3. Usage Tracking Integration
Updated controllers to track API usage:
- `postHashData.js`: OpenAI API calls with token counting
- `getHashData.js`: RapidAPI Word and Dictionary calls
- All APIs check usage limits before making calls
- Returns 402 Payment Required status when limits exceeded

### 4. New API Endpoint
- **Route**: `GET /api/data/usage`
- **Function**: `getUserUsageData` in `getHashData.js`
- Returns comprehensive usage statistics for authenticated users

### 5. Frontend Integration

#### Redux Store Updates
- Added `getUserUsage` action to `dataSlice.js`
- Added usage state management (userUsage, userUsageIsLoading, etc.)
- Integrated with existing authentication and error handling

#### Enhanced Profile Component
- **File**: `frontend/src/pages/Profile/Profile.jsx`
- **New Features**:
  - Real-time API usage display
  - Visual progress bar with color coding (green/orange/red)
  - Usage breakdown by API type
  - Monthly limit tracking
  - Upgrade prompts for Free users
  - Responsive design for mobile devices

#### Professional UI Design
- **File**: `frontend/src/pages/Profile/Profile.css`
- **Features**:
  - Modern card-based layout
  - Color-coded usage indicators
  - Animated progress bars
  - Mobile-responsive design
  - Hover effects and transitions
  - Professional color scheme matching existing design

### 6. Usage Data Format
The usage data is stored in the user's text field using this compact format:
```
|Usage:openai-2024-08-30:150t:$0.05,rapidword-2024-08-30:5c:$0.01,rapiddef-2024-08-30:3c:$0.01
```

Where:
- `openai-2024-08-30:150t:$0.05` = OpenAI API, date, 150 tokens, cost $0.05
- `rapidword-2024-08-30:5c:$0.01` = RapidAPI word, date, 5 calls, cost $0.01
- `rapiddef-2024-08-30:3c:$0.01` = RapidAPI definition, date, 3 calls, cost $0.01

### 7. Membership Integration
- **Free**: No API access, shows upgrade prompt
- **Flex**: $10 monthly limit, tracks usage with visual indicators
- **Premium**: $10 monthly limit but treated as unlimited for display

### 8. Error Handling & User Experience
- Graceful handling of API limit exceeded scenarios
- Clear error messages and upgrade prompts
- Loading states and error states
- Automatic token expiration handling
- Fallback displays when data unavailable

## Files Modified/Created

### Backend Files
- `backend/utils/apiUsageTracker.js` (NEW)
- `backend/controllers/postHashData.js` (Modified)
- `backend/controllers/getHashData.js` (Modified)
- `backend/controllers/index.js` (Modified)
- `backend/routes/routeData.js` (Modified)

### Frontend Files
- `frontend/src/features/data/dataService.js` (Modified)
- `frontend/src/features/data/dataSlice.js` (Modified)
- `frontend/src/pages/Profile/Profile.jsx` (Modified)
- `frontend/src/pages/Profile/Profile.css` (Modified)

## Usage Statistics Display
The Profile page now shows:
- Current usage amount in dollars
- Monthly limit based on membership
- Remaining balance
- Usage percentage with visual progress bar
- Recent API usage breakdown by service
- Upgrade prompts for Free users
- Color-coded warnings (green, orange, red) based on usage level

## Benefits
1. **Transparency**: Users can see exactly how much they've used
2. **Control**: Clear limits prevent unexpected costs
3. **Monetization**: Encourages upgrades to paid plans
4. **Professional**: Modern UI that matches your app's design
5. **Scalable**: Easy to add new APIs or adjust pricing
6. **Mobile-friendly**: Responsive design works on all devices

The system is now fully functional and ready for testing. Users can see their API usage in real-time on their Profile page, and the system will automatically prevent API calls when limits are exceeded.
